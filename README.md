ðŸŽ® Flappy Bird Game in ARM Assembly

Istanbul Technical University â€“ Microprocessor Systems Project

This project is a Flappy Bird clone developed entirely in ARM Cortex-M0 Assembly language, using a virtual LCD display. The goal was to explore low-level programming concepts such as ARM instructions, stack operations, interrupts, and register-level graphics rendering.

The game includes:
	â€¢	Real-time button interrupt handling for bird control
	â€¢	Custom image rendering for the game map and character
	â€¢	Collision detection and end-game screen logic (win/lose)
	â€¢	Manual memory and register management for performance and hardware constraints

This project strengthened our understanding of embedded systems, bare-metal programming, and low-level graphics logic on ARM microcontrollers.
